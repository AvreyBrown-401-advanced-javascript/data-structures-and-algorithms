# BinarySearch
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Tasked to create a function that outputs the given index value of a number in the array, or return -1

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I created a variable called counter and set it equal to i inside of a for loop, afterwards I created an if statement, wherin if counter was greater than 0, I returned counter, else return -1
